# comp150-cpd

## Week 1
Our first week in lectures and the Lego Robot Olympics were held. Our first major challenge was that we had n idea how to program the robots  but after a lot of testing we figured out how it all worked. After that we then had to understand what values to put in to get the most favourable result. After even more trial and error we understood how the values worked and what values we needed to put in in order to complete the tasks at hand.

## Week 2
In week 2 we began our regular scehdule which consisted of 4 main blocks of teaching. We also began using Python and IDE's

## Week 3
Week 3 mainly consisted on finishing our first paper review and getting the second paper as to start analysing that. We also began looking into Pygame and learnt some basic python programming.

## Week 4
This week mainly consisted on using version control as it is useful when working in a group as then everyone knows what has been done and what needs to be done. We look at tortoise git as a way of utilizing this.

## Week 5
In this week we handed in out reading from week 3 and started analysing our third piece of work. 

## Week 6
This week mostly involved the comp 120 tinkering graphics assignment but unfortunatly I was ill during the week so Jack had to do most of the work himself.

## Week 7
In this week we handed in our third piece of reading work and were given our fourth and final piece of reading to analyse for the research journal. We also had to do a presentation for our comp 150 Agile Essay. I was only able to attend the major lectures as I was still ill.

## Week 8
Still ill but was able to talk to Jack about finishing up our comp 120 tinkering graphics assignment.

## Week 9
New comp 120 assignment is about audio to which I have no skill in.

## Week 10
Research Journal and Agile essay are due soon but I can't compile the agile essay. My progress this semester has been slowed to almost a halt due to missing lectures with illness but I'll continue on and see how the rest of the year plays out.

## Week 11
The final week, hopefully next semester will go much soother than this one.
