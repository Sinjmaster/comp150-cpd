## Week 1
Our first week in lectures and the Lego Robot Olympics were held. Our first major challenge was that we had n idea how to program the robots  but after a lot of testing we figured out how it all worked. After that we then had to understand what values to put in to get the most favourable result. After even more trial and error we understood how the values worked and what values we needed to put in in order to complete the tasks at hand.

## Week 2
In week 2 we began our regular scehdule which consisted of 4 main blocks of teaching.
